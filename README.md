 Track "By Use" proficiencies for 5th Edition D&D


One of the DMs in our group is unhappy with the way proficiency works in 5th edition. The more you use a 
skill, tool, or weapon the better you get at using it. Initially it added every check total together. As the 
total passed various thesholds your proficincy bonus applied to that skill, tool, or weapon would increase.

After one player had a 4 in wisdom and 6 in charisma (In a different campaign with one of the other DMs)
negative rolls became quite regular and would lead to a reduction in "experience" which seemed silly. Around
this time he decided to migrate to asystem where every roll incremented the total by one. Things are busy, I
don't have the new thresholds yet and rewrote the whole thing shortly before publishing it so I haven't
implemented it yet.

I'm trying to update this regulary.
